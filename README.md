# Kourosh Afsharpour

Real-time simulation and systems programmer focused on physically grounded models,
engine-level development, and interactive evaluation under real-time constraints.

## About

My work centers on real-time simulation as a foundation for interactive systems,
games, and research-oriented evaluation. I am particularly interested in
physics-based modeling, numerical stability, and building transparent simulation
pipelines that remain controllable and interpretable under real-time constraints.

My background spans engine-level development in Unity and Unreal Engine,
research-oriented simulation systems, and shipped interactive applications.

## Projects

### Vehicle Physics for Real-Time Simulation (Unreal Engine, C++)
Research-oriented vehicle dynamics system developed from first principles.

- Custom raycast-based wheel and suspension model
- Tire forces modeled using Pacejka Magic Formula 5.2 with transient slip dynamics
- Fully custom drivetrain with physically interpretable torque propagation
- Designed for numerical stability under variable frame rates (down to ~15 FPS)

This system serves both as an interactive simulation platform and as a research
testbed for studying physically grounded dynamics under real-time constraints.

### Airplane Flight Simulator (Unity, C#)
Open-world arcade flight game released on iOS, Android, and Fire OS.

- Role: Lead / main programmer
- Implemented aircraft physics, mission systems, and core gameplay logic
- Designed and optimized large-scale environments for mobile hardware
- Implemented asynchronous scene loading, asset-bundle-based world management,
  and custom LOD solutions for dense environments

This project emphasized building robust systems that balance physical behavior,
player interaction, and strict real-time performance constraints.
