# Kourosh Afsharpour

Game and simulation programmer focused on physics-based mechanics,
engine-level systems, and real-time interactive experiences.

## About

My work centers on games and interactive simulations as computational systems.
I design and implement physics-based mechanics, real-time simulation pipelines,
and engine-level systems that shape player interaction, learning, and experience.

My background spans engine-level development in Unity and Unreal Engine,
research-oriented simulation systems, and shipped interactive applications.

## Selected Game and Simulation Projects

### Vehicle Physics for Real-Time Simulation (Unreal Engine, C++)
Research-oriented vehicle dynamics system developed from first principles.

- Custom raycast-based wheel and suspension model
- Tire forces modeled using Pacejka Magic Formula 5.2 with transient slip dynamics
- Fully custom drivetrain with physically interpretable torque propagation
- Designed for numerical stability under variable frame rates (down to ~15 FPS)

This system serves both as an interactive simulation platform and as a research
testbed for studying physically grounded dynamics under real-time constraints.

While technically motivated, this system was developed to support game mechanics
where traction, loss of control, and vehicle behavior are legible to players
through interaction rather than abstract UI.

### Airplane Flight Simulator (Unity, C#)
Open-world arcade flight game released on iOS, Android, and Fire OS.

- Role: Lead / main programmer
- Implemented aircraft physics, mission systems, and core gameplay logic
- Designed and optimized large-scale environments for mobile hardware
- Implemented asynchronous scene loading, asset-bundle-based world management,
  and custom LOD solutions for dense environments

This project was designed first and foremost as a game, emphasizing player
control, exploration, and progression, while requiring robust real-time systems
to support large-scale worlds and consistent flight mechanics on mobile hardware.
